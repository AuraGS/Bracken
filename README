KRAKEN ABUNDANCE ESTIMATION
===========================

Three steps are necessary to set up Kraken abundance estimation. It is assumed that
${KRAKEN_DB} is the path to a built Kraken database, and all sequences are as '.fna' files in the
${KRAKEN_DB}/library directory.

Step 1: Search all library input sequences against the database

kraken --db=${KRAKEN_DB} --fasta-input --threads=10 <( find -L library -name "*.fna" -exec cat {} + )  > database.kraken

Step 2: Compute the classifications for each perfect read of ${READ_LENGTH} base pairs from one of the input sequences.
With ${READ_LENGTH} = 75:

count-kmer-abundances.pl 75 database.kraken  > database75mers.kraken_cnts

Step 3:

Given the expected kmer distribution for genomes in a kraken database along
with a kraken report file, the number of reads belonging to each species (or
genus) is estimated using the estimate_abundance.py file, run with the
following command line:

    > python estimate_abundance.py -i KRAKEN.REPORT -k KMER_DISTR.TXT -l
      CLASSIFICATON_LEVEL -t THRESHOLD -o OUTPUT_FILE.TXT

The following required parameters must be specified:
- KRAKEN.REPORT     :: the kraken report generated for a given dataset 
- KMER_DISTR.TXT    :: the file generated by generate_kmer_distribution.py 
- OUTPUT_FILE.TXT   :: the desired name of the output file to be generated by the code

The following optional parameters may be specified:
- CLASSIFICATION_LEVEL  :: [Default = 'S'] This specifies that abundance
    estimation will calculate estimated reads for each species. Other possible
    options are K (kingdom level), P (phylum), C (class), O (order), F (family),
    and G (genus). 
- THRESHOLD             :: [Default = 10]  For species classification, any species
    with <= 10 (or otherwise specified) reads will not receive any additional reads
    from higher taxonomy levels when distributing reads for abundance estimation.
    If another classification level is specified, thresholding will occur at
    that level.
